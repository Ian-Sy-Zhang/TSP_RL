# Project TSP Solutions Collection

Welcome to the TSP Solutions Collection! This repository is a comprehensive suite of applications, each tailored to tackle different variants of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a variety of algorithms and methodologies.

Below is the structure of the project along with brief descriptions for each sub-directory. Each sub-directory includes its own README file with detailed instructions and documentation specific to the individual project.

## Directory Structure

- **1TSP/**  
  Basic Traveling Salesman Problem solutions using classical approaches.

- **2Multi_objective_TSP/**  
  Solutions for the Multi-objective Traveling Salesman Problem where multiple criteria are optimized simultaneously.

- **3Large_scale_TSP/**  
  Techniques and algorithms suitable for solving large-scale instances of the TSP.

- **4TimeWindowTSP/**  
  Solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows, where each city must be visited within a specific time frame.

- **5MFEA/**  
  Implementation of a Multi-Task Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) for solving multiple instances of TSP through a unified approach.

## General Usage

Each sub-directory is a standalone project and can be used independently. To get started with any specific TSP variant:

1. Navigate to the desired sub-directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the README file located within that sub-directory.
